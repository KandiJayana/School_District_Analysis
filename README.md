# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
- I replaced the math and reading scores for the ninth graders students at Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Then, I repeated the school district analysis that I have done before in PyCitySchools.ipynb file to update all the metrics based on the informations that I have replaced. 
## Results:
- For the District Summary, the Average Math Score changed and here is the before and after images:

- For the School Summary, the greater changes are on Thomas High School as it shows in the images ("Before"/"After") below:

- After we replaced the ninth graders’ math and reading scores for Thomas High School’s, we can see that the performance relative to the other schools changed as you can see on the images above: 
  - The Average Math Score went down by 0.06%
  - The Average Reading Score went up by 0.04%
  - The % Passing Math went down by 0.08%
  - The % Passing Reading went down by 0.29%
  - The % Overal Passing went down by 0.31%

- This is how replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade before and after:

## Summary
- Here are the four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs: 
  
   - Average Math Score
   - Average Reading Score
   - % Passing Math
   - % Passing Reading
   - % Overall Passing
